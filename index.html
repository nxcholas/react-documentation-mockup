          React uses an HTML-in-JavaScript syntax called JSX (JavaScript and XML). Familiarity with both HTML and JavaScript will help you to learn JSX, and better identify whether bugs in your application are related to JavaScript or to the more specific domain of React.

          Unlike the other frameworks covered in this module, React does not enforce strict rules around code conventions or file organization. This allows teams to set conventions that work best for them, and to adopt React in any way they would like to. React can handle a single button, a few pieces of an interface, or an app's entire user interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          While React can be used for small pieces of an interface, it's not as easy to "drop into" an application as a library like jQuery, or even a framework like Vue â€” it is more approachable when you build your entire app with React.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, many of the developer-experience benefits of a React app, such as writing interfaces with JSX, require a compilation process. Adding a compiler like Babel to a website makes the code on it run slowly, so developers often set up such tooling with a build step. React arguably has a heavy tooling requirement, but it can be learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          This article is going to focus on the use case of using React to render the entire user interface of an application with the support of Vite, a modern front-end build tool.

          React utilizes features of modern JavaScript for many of its patterns. Its biggest departure from JavaScript comes with the use of JSX syntax. JSX extends JavaScript's syntax so that HTML-like code can live alongside it. For example:
        </p>
        <div class="code-example">
            <div class="code-header"><span class="language-name">JSX</span></div>
            <div class="code-content">
                <code>
                    const heading = &lth1&gtMozilla Developer Network&lt/h1&gt    
                 </code>
            </div> 
        </div>
        <p>
          This heading constant is known as a JSX expression. React can use it to render that &lth1&gt tag in our app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose we wanted to wrap our heading in a &ltheader&gt tag, for semantic reasons? The JSX approach allows us to nest our elements within each other, just like we do with HTML:
        </p>
            <code>
                <p>JSX</p>
                <p>
        
          &ltp&gtconst header = (
  &ltheader&gt
    &lth1&gtMozilla Developer Network&lt/h1&gt
  &lt/header&gt
);
          </p>
            </code>

        <p>In order to use Vite, you need to have Node.js installed. As of Vite 5.0, at least Node version 18 or later is required, and it's a good idea to run the latest long term support (LTS) version when you can. As of 24th October 2023, Node 20 is the latest LTS version. Node includes npm (the Node package manager).</p>
        <p>To check your version of Node, run the following in your terminal:</p>
        <code><div></div></code>
        <p>If Node is installed, you'll see a version number. If it isn't, you'll see an error message. To install Node, follow the instructions on the Node.js website.</p>
        <p>You may use the Yarn package manager as an alternative to npm but we'll assume you're using npm in this set of tutorials. See Package management basics for more information on npm and yarn.</p>
        <p>If you're using Windows, you will need to install some software to give you parity with Unix/macOS terminal in order to use the terminal commands mentioned in this tutorial. Gitbash (which comes as part of the git for Windows toolset) or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) are both suitable. See Command line crash course for more information on these, and on terminal commands in general.</p>
        <p>Also bear in mind that React and ReactDOM produce apps that only work on a fairly modern set of browsers like Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, or Chrome when working through these tutorials.</p>
        <p>See the following for more information:</p>

        <p>The npm package manager comes with a create command that allows you to create new projects from templates. We can use it to create a new app from Vite's standard React template. Make sure you cd to the place you'd like your app to live on your machine, then run the following in your terminal:</p>
        <code><div></div</code>
        <p>This creates a moz-todo-react directory using Vite's react template.</p>
        <p>Your terminal will have printed some messages if this command was successful. You should see text prompting you to cd to your new directory, install the app's dependencies, and run the app locally. Let's start with two of those commands. Run the following in your terminal:</p>
        <code><div></div</code>
        <p>Once the process is complete, we need to start a local development server to run our app. Here, we're going to add some command line flags to Vite's default suggestion to open the app in our browser as soon as the server starts, and use port 3000.</p>
        <p>Run the following in your terminal:</p>
        <code><div></div</code>
        <p>Once the server starts, you should see a new browser tab containing your React app:</p>
